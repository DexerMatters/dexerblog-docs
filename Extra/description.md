## Extra posts!
It's where **people** post or link their markdown blogs onto my website. Feel free to post stuff here under the following rules:
1. No spam, ads, or any other form of self-promotion.
2. No illegal content or adult material.
3. No personal information.

## How to post?
You can create a pull request to the [repository](https://github.com/DexerMatters/dexerblog-docs). You can only post markdown files and they must be placed in the `Extra` folder. You can also link your remote markdown files into `Extra/.link` according to the [format](https://github.com/DexerMatters/dexerblog-docs/blob/main/Works/Crate/.link).
